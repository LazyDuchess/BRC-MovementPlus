<p style="text-align: center;">MovementPlus revamps and introduces multiple new movement mechanics to allow for faster, more rewarding gameplay. Many of the features included can be tweaked or outright disabled via the config file. MovementPlus aims to not only adjust vanilla movement mechanics but also to stand as its own seperate entity with a different level of balance in mind.</p>
