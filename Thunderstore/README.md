 ## Installation

 - Ensure you have BepInEx 5.4.21 installed, if you do not have that installed you can find it [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
 - Navigate to the Bomb Rush Cyberfunk folder, if you have the steam version it is located at this path "Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\BombRushCyberfunk"
 - Place the MovementPlus.dll into the \BepInEx\plugins folder, if you have BepInEx installed correctly this folder should already exist
 - Launch the game<br>

 - Alternatively you can use r2modman and let that handle the entire process for you, it can be found [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/ebkr/r2modman/)


## Configuration
 There are multiple ways to edit the config, make sure you've run the game with the mod at least once<br><br>

 - The simplest is to just use the built in config editor in r2modman to edit the config<br>

 - You can edit it manually, you can find the config file in the \BepInEx\config folder, it should be named com.yuril. MovementPlus.cfg<br>

 - You can use [this tool](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) to edit the values in-game in real time, some changes may only take effect on entering a new area
